This is my **first Power BI project**, where I have analyzed and visualized sales data for a fictional company named **Electorhub**. The company deals in various product categories, including **Electronics, Footwear, Clothing, Home Appliances, Accessories, Kitchenware, Bags, and Personal Care**.  

## Overview  

The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive dashboard in **Power BI** to provide actionable insights based on the sales data. The project involved:  
- Cleaning and transforming the data using **Power BI's data cleaning capabilities**.  
- Designing and implementing visuals and reports to meet the business requirements.  

## Business Requirements  

The dashboard addresses the following key requirements:  

1. **Top/Bottom 5 Products**  
   - Visualize the top and bottom 5 products by **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity Sold**.  

2. **Sales Trends**  
   - Analyze how sales trends vary over time:  
     - **Daily**  
     - **Monthly**  
     - **Quarterly**  
     - **Annually**  

3. **Sales & Profit Relationship**  
   - Provide insights into the relationship between **Sales** and **Profit** using scatter plots.  

4. **Period Comparison**  
   - Allow users to compare **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity Sold** between any two time periods of their choice using slicers.  

5. **Average Discount Analysis**  
   - Calculate and display the **average discount** offered in each discount category.  

6. **Total Orders**  
   - Display the **total number of orders** placed.  

7. **Detailed Order Information**  
   - Show all order details such as **Sales**, **Profit**, **Discount**, **Net Sales**, and other fields.  
   - Provide filters to allow users to filter data based on:  
     - **Product**  
     - **Date**  
     - **Customer ID**  
     - **Promotion Categories**  

8. **City-wise Sales Analysis**  
   - Visualize sales data by different cities to identify regional trends.  

## Tools and Techniques  

- **Power BI**  
  - Data cleaning and transformation using **Power Query Editor**.  
  - Designing an interactive dashboard with various visuals, including:  
    - Bar charts  
    - Line charts  
    - Scatter plots  
    - Matrix tables  
  - Implementing DAX measures for calculations like **average discount**, **net sales**, and **period comparison metrics**.  

## Insights  

- Identified the top-performing products and categories in terms of sales and profit.  
- Revealed seasonal trends, helping understand peak sales periods.  
- Found strong correlations between sales and profit for certain categories, while others had lower profit margins.  
- Provided actionable insights on discounts and their impact on sales and profitability.  
- Highlighted regions with high/low sales performance for better-targeted marketing.
